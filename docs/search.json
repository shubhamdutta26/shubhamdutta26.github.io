    "text": "The mechanism of action of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in mitochondrial oxidative stress (MOS)-mediated apoptotic tissue injury was investigated. MOS-mediated gastric mucosal apoptosis and injury were introduced in rat by indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Here, we report that HO-1 was not only induced but also translocated to mitochondria during gastric mucosal injury to favor repair mechanisms. Furthermore, mitochondrial translocation of HO-1 resulted in the prevention of MOS and mitochondrial pathology as evident from the restoration of the complex I-driven mitochondrial respiratory control ratio and transmembrane potential. Mitochondrial translocation of HO-1 also resulted in time-dependent inhibition of apoptosis. We searched for the plausible mechanisms responsible for HO-1 induction and mitochondrial localization. Free heme, the substrate for HO-1, was increased inside mitochondria during gastric injury, and mitochondrial entry of HO-1 decreased intramitochondrial free heme content, suggesting that a purpose of mitochondrial translocation of HO-1 is to detoxify accumulated heme. Heme may activate nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 to induce HO-1 through reactive oxygen species generation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies indicated nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 and its binding to HO-1 promoter to induce HO-1 expression during gastric injury. Inhibition of HO-1 by zinc protoporphyrin aggravated the mucosal injury and delayed healing. Zinc protoporphyrin further reduced the respiratory control ratio and transmembrane potential and enhanced MOS and apoptosis. In contrast, induction of HO-1 by cobalt protoporphyrin reduced MOS, corrected mitochondrial dysfunctions, and prevented apoptosis and gastric injury. Thus, induction and mitochondrial localization of HO-1 are a novel cytoprotective mechanism against MOS-mediated apoptotic tissue injury.\n\n\n\nZnPP aggravates gastric mucosal injury and slows down healing process in vivo."

    "text": "Microtiter plates or microplates have become a standard tool in analytical research and clinical diagnostic testing laboratories. They are convenient, high-throughput tools for organizing tissue culture, PCR tests (such as HIV/ COVID screening), or immunological assays such as ELISA, RIA and FIA. They offer many advantages over traditional assay formats including reduced sample and reagent volumes, increased throughput, and ease of automation. The goal of tidyplate is to help researchers convert different types of microplates into tidy dataframes which can be used in data analysis. tidyplate accepts xlsx and csv files formatted in a specific way as input. tidyplate supports all types of standard microplate formats namely: 6-well, 12-well, 24-well, 48-well, 96-well, 384-well, and 1536-well plates.\ntidyplate has four functions:\n\ntidy_plate: Transforms the input file (xlsx or csv) into a tidy dataframe.\ncheck_plate: Checks whether the input file is valid for use with tidy_plate().\nview_plate_names: Returns names/ id(s) of each plate in the input file.\nbuild_plate: Generates a csv or xlsx template for each plate type.\n\n\n\nTo install tidyplate from CRAN:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyplate\")\n\nYou can install the development version of tidyplate from GitHub with:\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"shubhamdutta26/tidyplate\")\n\n\n\n\nThe input excel or csv file should be formatted in a specific way:\n\nTop left corner must hold the name for that plate.\nColumn names should be: 1, 2, 3, and so on and so forth.\nRow names should be: A, B, C, and so on and so forth.\nThere must be an empty row between each plate.\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example which shows you how to use the tidyplate. If the input file is an xlsx file it reads the first sheet by default. Users can specify sheet using the sheet argument for an xlsx file. Users can also specify the variable name of column where well ids will be stored (defaults to “well”). Please make sure that well_id argument does not match individual plate names in the input file.\nFirst check if the input file is valid or not:\n\nlibrary(tidyplate)\nfile &lt;- system.file(\"extdata\", \n                    \"example_12_well.xlsx\", \n                    package = \"tidyplate\")\ncheck_plate(file) # No error for valid file\n\nexample_12_well.xlsx: OK; Plate type: 12-well\n\nincorrect_file &lt;- system.file(\"extdata\",\n                              \"incorrect_format.csv\",\n                              package = \"tidyplate\")\ncheck_plate(incorrect_file) # Error type displayed\n\nError: Verify row and column ids in incorrect_format.csv.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the formatting of the input file is very important. A csv or excel template for each plate type can be created using the build_plate function:\n\nbuild_plate(plate_type = 96, \n            n_plates = 2, \n            file_type = \"xlsx\") # default is csv\n\nIf you want to retrieve the names of individual plates:\n\nview_plate_names(file)\n\n[1] \"drug\"             \"cell_line\"        \"percent_survived\"\n\n\nRead and import the file as a tibble:\n\ndata &lt;- tidy_plate(file)\n\nData: example_12_well.xlsx; Plate type: 12-well plate\n\nhead(data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  well  drug      cell_line percent_survived\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;int&gt;\n1 A01   Neomycin  HEK293                  60\n2 A02   Puromycin HEK293                  NA\n3 A03   Neomycin  Hela                    52\n4 A04   Puromycin Hela                    18\n5 B01   Neomycin  HEK293                  62\n6 B02   Puromycin HEK293                  23\n\n\nImport multiple csv files into separate tibbles:\n\ncsv_files &lt;- list.files(path = file, \n                        pattern = \"*.csv\",\n                        full.names = TRUE)\n\nnames &lt;- tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(csv_files))\n\n# Loop through the filenames and assign data\nfor(i in seq_along(csv_files)) {\n  assign(names[i], tidy_plate(csv_files[i]))\n}\n\nImport multiple csv files as a list of tibbles:\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store tibbles for each file\ntb_csv_list &lt;- list()\n\n# Loop through the filenames and assign data\nfor(i in seq_along(csv_files)) {\n  tb_csv_list[[i]] &lt;- tidy_plate(csv_files[i])\n}\n\nFor multiple excel sheets in the same excel file:\n\n# as individual tibbles\nxl_file &lt;- system.file(\"extdata\", \n                       \"multisheet_example.xlsx\", \n                       package = \"tidyplate\")\n\nsheets &lt;- readxl::excel_sheets(xl_file)\n\nfor (sheet in sheets) {\n  tb &lt;- tidy_plate(xl_file, sheet = sheet)\n  name &lt;- paste0(\"tb_\", sheet)\n  assign(name, tb)\n}\n\nData: multisheet_example.xlsx; Plate type: 6-well plate\n\n\nData: multisheet_example.xlsx; Plate type: 12-well plate\nData: multisheet_example.xlsx; Plate type: 12-well plate\n\n# as elements of a list\n# Initialize an empty list to store tibbles for each sheet\ntb_xl_list &lt;- list()\n\nfor (sheet in sheets) {\n  tb_xl_list[[sheet]] &lt;- tidy_plate(xl_file, sheet = sheet)\n}\n\nData: multisheet_example.xlsx; Plate type: 6-well plate\nData: multisheet_example.xlsx; Plate type: 12-well plate\nData: multisheet_example.xlsx; Plate type: 12-well plate\n\n\n\n\n\nDutta, Shubham. 2024.

    "text": "The Hippo pathway regulates the transcriptional coactivator YAP to control cell proliferation, organ size, and stem cell maintenance. Multiple factors, such as substrate stiffness, cell density, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling, regulate YAP through their effects on the F-actin cytoskeleton, although the mechanism is not known. Here we show that angiomotin proteins (AMOT130, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2) connect F-actin architecture to YAP regulation. First, we show that angiomotins are required to relocalize YAP to the cytoplasm in response to various manipulations that perturb the actin cytoskeleton. Second, angiomotins associate with F-actin through a conserved F-actin-binding domain, and mutants defective for F-actin binding show enhanced ability to retain YAP in the cytoplasm. Third, F-actin and YAP compete for binding to AMOT130, explaining how F-actin inhibits AMOT130-mediated cytoplasmic retention of YAP. Furthermore, we find that LATS can synergize with F-actin perturbations by phosphorylating free AMOT130 to keep it from associating with F-actin. Together these results uncover a mechanism for how F-actin levels modulate YAP localization, allowing cells to make developmental and proliferative decisions based on diverse inputs that regulate actin architecture.\n\n\n\nModel of F-actin–regulated angiomotin (AMOT) inhibition of YAP."

    "text": "The transcriptional co-activator YAP controls cell proliferation, survival, and tissue regeneration in response to changes in the mechanical environment. It is not known how mechanical stimuli such as tension are sensed and how the signal is transduced to control YAP activity. Here, we show that the LIM domain protein TRIP6 acts as part of a mechanotransduction pathway at adherens junctions to promote YAP activity by inhibiting the LATS1/2 kinases. Previous studies showed that vinculin at adherens junctions becomes activated by mechanical tension. We show that vinculin inhibits Hippo signaling by recruiting TRIP6 to adherens junctions and stimulating its binding to and inhibition of LATS1/2 in response to tension. TRIP6 competes with MOB1 for binding to LATS1/2 thereby blocking MOB1 from recruiting the LATS1/2 activating kinases MST1/2. Together, these findings reveal a novel pathway that responds to tension at adherens junctions to control Hippo pathway signaling.\n\n\n\nTRIP6 inhibits Hippo signaling in response to tension at adherens junctions\n\n\n\n\nMechanical tension regulates Hippo signaling via the mechanosensor vinculin at adherens junctions.
