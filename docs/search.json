    "text": "The mechanism of action of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in mitochondrial oxidative stress (MOS)-mediated apoptotic tissue injury was investigated. MOS-mediated gastric mucosal apoptosis and injury were introduced in rat by indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Here, we report that HO-1 was not only induced but also translocated to mitochondria during gastric mucosal injury to favor repair mechanisms. Furthermore, mitochondrial translocation of HO-1 resulted in the prevention of MOS and mitochondrial pathology as evident from the restoration of the complex I-driven mitochondrial respiratory control ratio and transmembrane potential. Mitochondrial translocation of HO-1 also resulted in time-dependent inhibition of apoptosis. We searched for the plausible mechanisms responsible for HO-1 induction and mitochondrial localization. Free heme, the substrate for HO-1, was increased inside mitochondria during gastric injury, and mitochondrial entry of HO-1 decreased intramitochondrial free heme content, suggesting that a purpose of mitochondrial translocation of HO-1 is to detoxify accumulated heme. Heme may activate nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 to induce HO-1 through reactive oxygen species generation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies indicated nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 and its binding to HO-1 promoter to induce HO-1 expression during gastric injury. Inhibition of HO-1 by zinc protoporphyrin aggravated the mucosal injury and delayed healing. Zinc protoporphyrin further reduced the respiratory control ratio and transmembrane potential and enhanced MOS and apoptosis. In contrast, induction of HO-1 by cobalt protoporphyrin reduced MOS, corrected mitochondrial dysfunctions, and prevented apoptosis and gastric injury. Thus, induction and mitochondrial localization of HO-1 are a novel cytoprotective mechanism against MOS-mediated apoptotic tissue injury.\n\n\n\nZnPP aggravates gastric mucosal injury and slows down healing process in vivo."

    "text": "Microtiter plates or microplates have become a standard tool in analytical research and clinical diagnostic testing laboratories. They are convenient, high-throughput tools for organizing tissue culture, PCR tests (such as HIV/ COVID screening), or immunological assays such as ELISA, RIA and FIA. They offer many advantages over traditional assay formats including reduced sample and reagent volumes, increased throughput, and ease of automation. The goal of tidyplate is to help researchers convert different types of microplates into tidy dataframes which can be used in data analysis (Dutta 2024). tidyplate accepts xlsx and csv files formatted in a specific way as input. tidyplate supports all types of standard microplate formats namely: 6-well, 12-well, 24-well, 48-well, 96-well, 384-well, and 1536-well plates.\ntidyplate has two functions:\n\ntidy_plate: This function takes the input file (xlsx or csv) and transforms into a tidy dataframe.\ncheck_plate: This function checks whether the input file is valid for use with tidy_plate() function.\n\n\n\nTo install tidyplate from CRAN:\n\n# install.packages(\"tidyplate\")\n\nYou can install the development version of tidyplate from GitHub with:\n\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\n# devtools::install_github(\"shubhamdutta26/tidyplate\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure demonstrates how to format the 12-well plate input file. Colors are for visualization purposes only.\n\n\n\n\nThe input xlsx or csv should be formatted in a specific way:\n\nTop left corner must hold the name for that plate.\nColumn names should be: 1, 2, 3, and so on and so forth.\nRow names should be: A, B, C, and so on and so forth.\nThere must be an empty row between each plate.\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example which shows you how to use the tidyplate. If the input file is an xlsx file it reads the first sheet by default. Users can specify sheet using the sheet argument for an xlsx file. Users can also specify the variable name of column where well ids will be stored (defaults to “well”). Please make sure that well_id argument does not match individual plate names in the input file.\nFirst check if the input file is valid or not:\n\nlibrary(tidyplate)\ncheck_plate(\"example_12_well.xlsx\")\n\nexample_12_well.xlsx: OK; Plate type: 12 well\n\n\nImport the file as a tidy dataframe:\n\ndata &lt;- tidy_plate(\"example_12_well.xlsx\")\n\nData: example_12_well.xlsx; Plate type: 12 well plate\n\nhead(data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  well  drug      cell_line percent_survived\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;int&gt;\n1 A01   Neomycin  HEK293                  60\n2 A02   Puromycin HEK293                  22\n3 A03   Neomycin  Hela                    52\n4 A04   Puromycin Hela                    18\n5 B01   Neomycin  HEK293                  62\n6 B02   Puromycin HEK293                  23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDutta, Shubham. 2024.

Multiple factors, such as substrate stiffness, cell density, and G protein-coupled receptor signaling, regulate YAP through their effects on the F-actin cytoskeleton, although the mechanism is not known. Here we show that angiomotin proteins (AMOT130, AMOTL1, and AMOTL2) connect F-actin architecture to YAP regulation. First, we show that angiomotins are required to relocalize YAP to the cytoplasm in response to various manipulations that perturb the actin cytoskeleton. Second, angiomotins associate with F-actin through a conserved F-actin-binding domain, and mutants defective for F-actin binding show enhanced ability to retain YAP in the cytoplasm. Third, F-actin and YAP compete for binding to AMOT130, explaining how F-actin inhibits AMOT130-mediated cytoplasmic retention of YAP. Furthermore, we find that LATS can synergize with F-actin perturbations by phosphorylating free AMOT130 to keep it from associating with F-actin. Together these results uncover a mechanism for how F-actin levels modulate YAP localization, allowing cells to make developmental and proliferative decisions based on diverse inputs that regulate actin architecture.\n\n\n\nModel of F-actin–regulated angiomotin (AMOT) inhibition of YAP."

Previous studies showed that vinculin at adherens junctions becomes activated by mechanical tension.
