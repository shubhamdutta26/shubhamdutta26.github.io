## Synopsis

The mechanism of action of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in mitochondrial oxidative stress (MOS)-mediated apoptotic tissue injury was investigated. MOS-mediated gastric mucosal apoptosis and injury were introduced in rat by indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Here, we report that HO-1 was not only induced but also translocated to mitochondria during gastric mucosal injury to favor repair mechanisms. Furthermore, mitochondrial translocation of HO-1 resulted in the prevention of MOS and mitochondrial pathology as evident from the restoration of the complex I-driven mitochondrial respiratory control ratio and transmembrane potential. Mitochondrial translocation of HO-1 also resulted in time-dependent inhibition of apoptosis. We searched for the plausible mechanisms responsible for HO-1 induction and mitochondrial localization. Free heme, the substrate for HO-1, was increased inside mitochondria during gastric injury, and mitochondrial entry of HO-1 decreased intramitochondrial free heme content, suggesting that a purpose of mitochondrial translocation of HO-1 is to detoxify accumulated heme. Heme may activate nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 to induce HO-1 through reactive oxygen species generation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies indicated nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 and its binding to HO-1 promoter to induce HO-1 expression during gastric injury. Inhibition of HO-1 by zinc protoporphyrin aggravated the mucosal injury and delayed healing. Zinc protoporphyrin further reduced the respiratory control ratio and transmembrane potential and enhanced MOS and apoptosis. In contrast, induction of HO-1 by cobalt protoporphyrin reduced MOS, corrected mitochondrial dysfunctions, and prevented apoptosis and gastric injury. Thus, induction and mitochondrial localization of HO-1 are a novel cytoprotective mechanism against MOS-mediated apoptotic tissue injury.
