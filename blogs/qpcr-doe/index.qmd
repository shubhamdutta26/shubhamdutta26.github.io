## Generating standard curve for new primer pairs

#### Setting up the plate

1.  Make cDNA from 1 µg total RNA in 20 µl reaction volume and add 80 µl of ddH~2~O. This is the starting concentration.
2.  Make 1:10 dilution series (1:1, 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, 1:10000) of the sample. If you have multiple samples then combine equal amounts from each to make a pool before making the dilution series.
3.  The primers (HPLC purified) should have a stock concentration of 10 µM. Usually SYBR Green Master Mix will be at a 2X concentration.
4.  Prepare a master mix (usually 2 more than you need) of SYBR Green Master Mix (2X) and primers (0.4 µM each).
5.  Add 10 µl of the master mix to each well by reverse pipeting to avoid bubbles. In a similar fashion add 4 µl of the sample dilution series, primers and adjust the final volume to 20 µl with ddH~2~O. Run "No Template Controls (NTC)" containing no sample.
6.  Centrifuge the plate for a minute to ensure all contents are at the bottom of the plate.
7.  Seal your plate with qPCR optical seals and start the qPCR run on your qPCR machine.

#### **Melting Curves (Testing specificity)**

I run the [uMelt](https://dna-utah.org/umelt/quartz/) tool to predict the melting curve of the qPCR amplicon. In general a single peak in the melting curve plot indicates specificity. Below, we can see that the plot on the left (A) show a single peak indicating specificity and the right (A) one has double peaks indicating non-specific amplification.However, there are exceptions based on the amplicon sequence and it is good to run the uMelt tool.

### Setting up the plate

1.  Dilute cDNA 1:5 with nuclease free H~2~O.

2.  Set up a reaction with a 2X SYBR green master mix (for e.g. SsoAdvanced from BioRad) as follows:

    | Reagent                  | Volume | Final amount/ concentration |
    |--------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|
    | 2x SYBR green master mix | 10 µl  | 1x                          |
    | Forward primer           | 2 µl   | 250 nM                      |
    | Reverse primer           | 2 µl   | 250 nM                      |
    | cDNA                     | 5 µl   | 100ng - 100 fg              |
    | Nuclease free H~2~O      | 1 µl   |                             |
    | Total volume             | 20 µl  |                             |

3.  Make three technical replicate for each biological sample. There needs to be 3 biological replicates. Add NTC and NRT (No Reverse Transcriptase) controls.

4.  Make sure there are no bubbles. Spin the plate at 500xg for 2 minutes.

5.  Run the RT-qPCR protocol and analyse the data (see below).
